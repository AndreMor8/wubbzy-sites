which is managed by Starz Media, LLC (&quot;STM&quot;). STM and any and all entities
that control, are controlled by, or are affiliated or under common control with,
STM are collectively referred to herein as "we," "us" or "our".<br>
<br>IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. BY USING THE SITE YOU ARE UNCONDITIONALLY
AGREEING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, TOGETHER WITH THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE SITE
(WHICH, TOGETHER SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE &quot;SITE AGREEMENT&quot;). IF
YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE SITE AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.<br><br>STM
is committed to helping users of the Site understand the information STM collects,
how it uses that information, the choices users have about the way their information
is used, and the precautions STM takes to protect information concerning its
users. This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Site only, and covers
information collected on or through the Site. When using other STM sites, we
encourage you to review the Privacy Policy controlling that particular site.<br><br>A.
Information We Collect.<br><br>STM collects personally identifiable information
that you voluntarily submit in various contexts including, but not limited to:
(1) the registration or account creation process for the Site; (2) the registration
process for sweepstakes, contests, and other online promotions offered on the
Site; (3) your participation in online research surveys offered on the Site;
(4) the process to report a problem with the Site and resolving customer service
activities (including via email and chat), and (5) in connection with content
submissions, voting and polling activities. Such personally identifiable information
may include, without limitation, name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone
number.<br><br>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically collect information
that describes how you use the Site (which pages you visit and how long you stay,
plus the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser,
such as browser type, data that identifies the page you visited prior to and
after your visit to an Site, and your IP address). We also may determine what
technology is available through your browser so we can serve you the most appropriate
version of a page.<br><br>
Cookies are small information files that STM may place
on your computer to provide extended functionality. We may use cookies for a
number of purposes, such as tracking how visitors use the Site, limiting multiple
responses to polls or surveys, and recording your member registration information.
Cookies (including beacons), by themselves, do not provide STM with personally
identifiable information unless you choose to voluntarily provide this information
to us by, for example, registering on the Site. However, once you choose to furnish
us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to
the data stored in the cookie. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (see
your browser's manual or help file for instructions), but if you do turn off
cookies you may not be able to access parts of the Site where cookies are used.<br><br>You
should be aware that advertisers or other third parties serving content on the
Site may set and access their own cookies on your computer. We don't have control
over cookies placed by third parties. Such third parties' use of cookies is subject
to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. Such
third parties do not have access to our cookies.<br><br>An IP address is a number
assigned to your computer or network when you're on the Internet. It's usually
associated with the place you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service
Provider (ISP) or your school. When you visit pages on a Site, our servers log
your IP address. We collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes,
such as system administration and to keep track of the number of visits to different
pages on the Site.<br><br>While using the Site, you may encounter links to other
web sites or online materials. Those other web sites and any online advertising
servers delivering ads to Site may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or
have their own privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
Policy only covers information collected by STM, and we encourage you to review
the privacy policy of any other web site you visit.<br><br>This
Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information you
may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat rooms or discussion boards).
When you voluntarily post information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be collected and used by other people to send unsolicited messages
(or &quot;spam&quot;) and marketing materials. STM assumes no responsibility
for any action or policies of any third parties who collect information that
users disclose on discussion boards or in other public areas of the Site.<br><br>B.

Personally identifiable information is used by STM to, among other things: (1)
verify access rights to premium content or other access-restricted services,
including for purpose of supporting digital rights management software; (2) improve

identifiable information to third parties for their commercial purposes.<br><br>STM

assistance and providing customer service. Such entities and individuals are
required to protect your personally identifiable information in a manner that
is consistent with this Privacy Policy and to not use such personal information
for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for
STM.<br><br>STM may disclose your personally identifiable information to any
successor or to any person or entity that acquires ownership or control of the
Site, whether as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially
all of a web site's assets and/or services or otherwise. You hereby consent to
the disclosure to, and use by, any such successor or subsequent owner or operator,
and your continued use of the Site signifies your agreement to be bound by such
successor's or subsequent owner or operator's own terms of service and privacy
policy. STM is not responsible for any changes or modifications to this Privacy
Policy by any successor or subsequent owner or operator.<br><br>We
may share your personally identifiable information with companies that offer
products and/or services under the &quot;Starz&quot; brand name. STM may also share your information with companies that offer products and/or services that are co-branded using STM brand names. These companies are called &quot;co-branding

to third parties in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent
to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including
by means of our Privacy Policy; 3) we are required by law or court order to disclose,
or we believe in good faith that the law requires it; 4) disclosure is necessary
to identify, contact, or bring legal action against, someone who may cause or
be causing harm to, or interference with, our rights or property, other Site
users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that
you have made. We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service
providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with laws, to enforce
compliance with the Site Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, or to protect
the Site, our sites, customers, or others.<br><br>C.	How We Use the Non-Personally
Identifiable Information We Collect.<br><br>We currently contract with online
partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.
We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness
of our advertising and how visitors use the Site. To do this, we use web beacons
and cookies provided by our marketing company on the Site. For example, we use
cookies to: (1) personalize your experience when visiting the Site and using
the Site; (2) improve the design and content of the Site and/or the Content;
(3) analyze Site usage; (4) understand traffic patterns on the Site and to authorize
access to certain premium or trial content and product features and (5) track
your usage of the Site and/or the Content and to track your interactions with
the Site through third-party services. The type of information we collect includes
pages visited, content reviewed, usage levels for content, traffic patterns and
other similar usage information. By supplementing our records, this information
helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which
of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers
like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from
our Site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. STM
reserves the right to disclose or otherwise utilize this non-personally identifiable
information in aggregate form, for any purpose, in its sole judgment.<br><br>Finally,
you may request that your information be changed, corrected or deleted from our
databases by writing STM at: Starz Media, LLC, Customer Relations, 2950 Hollywood
Way, 3rd Floor Burbank, California 91505. Please Note: even if you opt out of
receiving commercial communications from STM, we reserve the right to send transactional
or relationship communications to you (e.g., if we need to contact you regarding
your account status, technical support, product information, changes to the subscriber
agreement, and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our
records on you and/or any products you purchased from us).<br><br>E.	Policies
for Individuals Under the Age of 13.<br><br>STM does not knowingly collect or
use any personally identifiable information submitted to the Site from individuals
under the age of 13, except in order to respond on a one-time basis to a specific
request for information. If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that
your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable
information without your permission or consent, upon notice from you, STM will
make reasonable efforts to remove the information. You may request that your
child's information be deleted from our databases by writing STM at: Starz Media,
LLC Customer Relations, 2950 Hollywood Way, 3rd Floor Burbank, California 91505,
and be sure to include in your message the same User Name and/or e-mail address
and password that your child submitted.<br><br>F.	Links to Other Sites.<br><br>STM
may from time to time offer links to other sites from sites within the STM domain.
Other sites may also reference, advertise, or link to our sites. We do not endorse
or sponsor other web sites, are not responsible for the privacy practices or
the content of such sites. STM expressly disclaims any and all statements or
assertions made on such web sites, and deny all liability associated with your
use of, and the content on, such other sites. You may arrive at one of these
sites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement,
or simply by selecting a link on the Site. These sites might issue their own
cookies or collect data or personally identifiable information.<br><br>Use caution
when visiting an external site. You use of such sites may be subject to the terms
of service and privacy policies posted on such sites. We recommend that you review
such site's terms of service and privacy policy prior to use.<br><br>G.	STM Security
Policy.<br><br>STM is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only
as much data as is required to make your Internet and/or product use experience
as efficient and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as possible.
We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that whatever information you provide
will be maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission
over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee
the security of any information you transmit to us or from our products or services,
and you provide such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission,
we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<br><br>H.	Consent
to Processing in the United States.<br><br>By providing any personally identifiable
information to STM, all users, including, without limitation, users in the member
states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this
Privacy Policy and to the collection and processing of such information in the
United States of America.<br><br>I.	Notification of Changes.

STM reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, discontinue,
enhance, add or remove any portion of the Site, or any provision of the Site
Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. Changes to the Site Agreement will
be effective when posted. Without obligation to do so, STM may also notify you
of such changes through messaging on the Site. You nevertheless agree to periodically
review the copies of the Site Agreement posted on the Site so that you are aware
of any changes. Your continued use of the Site in any way after any changes to
the Site Agreement or the Site are made or posted will be considered acceptance
of those changes and will constitute your agreement to be bound thereby.<br><br>J.
