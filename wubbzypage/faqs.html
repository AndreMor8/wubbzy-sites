<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: The Wubbzy
Team definitely agrees that it would be great to release a DVD with a never-before-seen
episode and our hope is that we can offer fans this potential opportunity on
future DVDs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, timing on the production of new episodes did
not allow for this on our first and second DVDs.&nbsp; The second one comes out
on February 3rd, 2009 and while the episodes have been shown on TV, we did try
to make it a Friendship themed DVD where all of the episodes focus on Friendship
and how to be a good friend.&nbsp; We definitely love the idea of new episodes
and will keep it in mind!<br />
