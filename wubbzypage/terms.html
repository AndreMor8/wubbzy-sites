Attn: Copyright Agent</p>
<p>By this filing, STM does not necessarily stipulate that it is a service provider
as defined in 17 USC section 512c or elsewhere in the law, but merely seeks to
preserve any and all exemptions from liability that may be available to it under
the copyright law or otherwise. If you believe in good faith that a notice of
copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) permits you to send STM a counter-notice
pursuant to the statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA, including, without
limitation, a statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act
on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If
we receive a proper notification (or if we believe in our sole and absolute discretion)
that any materials submitted or posted by you allegedly violate another person's
or entity's rights, we reserve the right to withdraw and remove the affected
material from our Site, at any time in our absolute discretion with or without
notice. You can find more information about the DMCA on the U.S. Copyright Office
website, currently located at https://www.loc.gov/copyright/. You are advised
to consult a legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Please be
forewarned that there can be penalties for false claims.</p>
