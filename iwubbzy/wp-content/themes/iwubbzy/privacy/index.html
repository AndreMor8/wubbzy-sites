<h5 style="text-align: justify;">How We Use Information</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">General: All personal information is collected for the purpose of providing our users access to the features and other activities provided on the website. Once registered, users can participate in registered member activities such as newsletters, message boards, certain contests and sweepstakes (for sweepstakes that are open to non-registered users, please see “General Activities: Contests and Online Sweepstakes” section below) and “Third Party” offers (the opportunity for registered members to receive information concerning special offers and promotions either sent by us on behalf of or in partnership with other third party businesses selected by us, or directly by such third parties).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may also use the personally identifiable information you provide about yourself to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, and to offer you special offers and promotions from businesses within the iwubbzy.com family of companies, and on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our sweepstakes or contests, to fulfill your request for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may combine information we collect through the Network with information that we collect from other sources (e.g., social media integration services (e.g. Facebook Connect), offline records or publicly available information) to further tailor our products, programs and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At any time after the registration process, registered members can choose to discontinue participating in some of the registered member activities (e.g. newsletters, NickJr.com advisory board, “Third Party” offers) or altogether unregister by electing to unsubscribe to such activity. Every newsletter you receive from us will have the option to unsubscribe at the bottom of the newsletter. Receiving marketing communications is voluntary. If at any time you wish to change your marketing preferences or opt out entirely from receiving further marketing information from us please follow the unsubscribe instructions in our e-mail communications or click here to opt out of receiving e-mail communication form us.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">More Information Regarding Certain Activities</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Online Contests and Sweepstakes iwubbzy.com may offer opportunities to enter contests and sweepstakes from time to time. In some instances, these contests and sweepstakes will be open to all registered users, and no additional personal information will be collected. In other instances, we may ask for information such as your full name, e-mail address, birth date, and in some instances, telephone numbers for certain types of contests and sweepstakes. We use this information for the purpose of conducting the contests and sweepstakes and do not (except as set forth herein) disclose such information to third parties, except with a fulfillment house which we use to help select winners and fulfill prizes and, in some cases, with third-party sponsors. From time to time, we may offer contests and sweepstakes sponsored by third party businesses and may share entrant information with such third party businesses. In these types of contests and sweepstakes, we will disclose to potential entrants that such information will be so supplied and the identity of the third party to whom such information will be supplied at the time entrant information is collected, and will provide potential entrants with the opportunity to opt out of such third party sponsored contests and sweepstakes. However, any information supplied to a third party may be retained by such third party and will be out of our control. We may maintain personal information collected online from contests and sweepstakes winners and may share that information with third parties for fulfillment purposes, as described above, as well as internally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In certain circumstances, entrants of contests and sweepstakes on the iwubbzy.com may have the opportunity to opt-in (by indicating so on the entry form) to become subscribers of newsletters and to receive other e-mail special announcements and promotions.  The personal information collected from those entrants who have chosen to opt-in to any newsletter or other subscription shall be maintained by the Network and may be shared with third parties for fulfillment purposes, as described above, as well as internally. Entrant’s decision not to opt-in to any subscription offers will not affect eligibility for contests and sweepstakes and will not impact chances of winning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In certain circumstances and where applicable entrants of a contest of sweepstakes may receive additional entries into the Sweepstakes by using the Tell-A-Friend page or feature.  In such instances please refer to the applicable contest or sweepstakes rules for how to receive additional entries.  In all instances and for the purposes of clarity we have established the following criteria for defining a “friend” for the purposes of Sweepstakes and Contests. A friend must be a personal contact who is over the age of 18, someone who the entrant knows or regularly corresponds with in a friendly business or personal context. Entrant must not refer: (1) a non-existent person or entrant’s self; (2) any person that entrant may have reason to believe may be offended or annoyed by being asked to participate in the Sweepstakes or Contest; (3) any person who has explicitly informed entrant they do not wish to participate in the Sweepstakes, Contest or Tell-a-Friend program; or (4) any person whom the entrant knows or believes is under the age of 18.  Entrants may not “spam” people via email. Spam is defined as unsolicited (unwanted, unrequested) email. If you’d like to refer someone, but are unsure if it would be appropriate, please contact them first to find out.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Electronic Newsletter and Special Announcements Subscription</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iwubbzy.com provides parents the opportunity to receive e-mails containing certain newsletters, along with other special announcements and activities. These emails and newsletters will be made available to users during the registration process, but users may also register for specific newsletters or email bulletins without registering. These e-mails will provide subscribers with information updates, announcements, and promotions. If you opt in to receive any such newsletters or announcements, your e-mail address may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the e-mails and perform other related technical and processing functions. At anytime after the signup process, users can choose to discontinue their subscriptions to all newsletters and special announcements altogether by electing to unsubscribe, through the unsubscribe option found at the bottom of each e-mail sent to users, or by clicking here.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">User Generated Content</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iwubbzy.com may offer opportunities to send video, images and other user generated content from time to time, sometimes in connection with a contest or sweepstakes, and sometimes as part of every day website activity. In some instances, we may ask for additional information as part of the upload process, such as your full name, e-mail address, birth date, the names and ages of your children, descriptions and other information concerning the content uploaded to us. We use this information for the purpose of conducting the UGV/UGC activities, and do not (except as set forth herein). From time to time, we may offer UGV/UGC activities sponsored by third party businesses, and may (with your permission) share your content and personal information with such third party businesses. In these types of activities, we will disclose to users that such information will be so supplied and the identity of the third party to whom such information will be supplied at the time the UGV/UGC is uploaded to us, and will provide users with the opportunity to opt out of such third party sponsored activities. However, any information supplied to a third party may be retained by such third party and will be out of our control.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Customer Service:</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Users and consumers over the age of 18 may e-mail us or use a third party service we deploy for the purposes of asking their questions our site, activates, applications or other questions related to our service.  Any personal information collected for customer-service inquiries are collected to help us respond to customer service questions. We use the e-mail address or other personal information specified during the inquiry to communicate directly with customers and provide them with answers that they may find helpful. We do not sell, transfer or share the e-mail address or any other personal information collected as a result of a customer service inquiry with third parties, with the exception that the information is transferred, disclosed and shared with our third party agent or service who uses the information solely to handle and manage customer service, but cannot use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Activities Area</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Activities Area on our website is an area of our site where parents can enjoy quality online entertainment with their children. This area includes Games, Stories, Music, Art, Shows and other activities, the design, content and language of which are targeted to children. The Activities area is fully compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is our policy in the activities area to require only the minimal collection of information from our visitors. Consistent with this policy, the Activities Area limits the collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, Computer Information). Some games and activities within the Activities area may feature an option for parents to register for the site, which would allow for saved game settings, and other special content. Any such registration opportunities in the Kids area will be optional, and in full compliance with COPPA. We do not condition participation of a parent and/or their child in any games or other online activities contained in the Kids area on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may, from time to time, share non-individual, aggregate information (e.g. non-personally identifiable information) about our users internally and externally with third parties, such as advertisers and business partners. We also use personal information collected on our site internally, however, it is our policy to not disclose personally identifiable information externally with third parties, except in the following instances:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Third Party Businesses: From time to time, we may partner with outside third parties to provide you with additional content, products, or services that we believe may be of interest. These partners operate websites that are separate and independent from our website. If you choose to “opt-in” (click on a box to receive a third party’s information), to register with one of our partners, or you choose not to “opt-out” (uncheck a checked box that will provide a partner with your information), that means you grant us the permission to give your registration and other information, including e-mail address, to that third party. If you do not wish to receive information from outside third parties, you can unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of any email you may receive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Agents: The personal information provided to us may be transferred, disclosed or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain activities (e.g., message boards, sweepstakes and contests, e-cards, newsletters, advisory board, etc.) and perform other technical and processing functions (e.g., sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from registration lists, programming, providing user services to our users or otherwise operating this website or other websites we own or operate). They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but May not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Some of these agents may request additional information during the course of offering their services. We encourage users to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those agents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business Transfers: In the event that assets relating to this site or the other sites that we own are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Online Contests and Sweepstakes: As discussed in the Contests and Sweepstakes section above. In addition to the fulfillment houses to whom we may supply personal information collected from contests and sweepstakes entrants for the purpose of helping us select winners and fulfill prizes, we may supply third-party sponsors with personal information collected from contests and sweepstakes entrants in connection with certain online contests and sweepstakes. In each such case, we will disclose to potential entrants that such information will be supplied to a third party, and the identity of such third party, at the time entrant information is collected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Special Cases: You acknowledge, consent, and agree that to the extent legally permissible in a jurisdiction we may access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect pursuant to Section II or other information and/or content to a law enforcement agency or another third party if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the owners of the Network, any user of any of the websites that comprise the Network, and the public. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our visitors or others.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Cookies &amp; Log Data</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unique identifiers such as cookies (which may be html files, Flash files, or other technology), web beacons, or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) are used to help tailor our content, allow users to move between our websites without logging into each site, and other purposes related to our management of our websites. Cookies are small text files stored locally on your machine that help store user preferences. “Web beacons” or “clear gifs” are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may use Tracking Technologies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements.  We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the use of Tracking Technologies as set forth in this Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In many internet browsers, you can choose to delete, disable, turn off or reject the Tracking Technologies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature. Additional information on deleting, disabling, rejecting or turning off Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.</p>

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Network and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although these Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the us, the Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies and/or they may otherwise have access to information about you.</p>

This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a Third Party Advertising Service Providers or advertiser may collect from you.
