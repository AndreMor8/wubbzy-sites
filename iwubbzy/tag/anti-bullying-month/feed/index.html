<p>October is <a title="Kids Agains Bullying" href="https://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/" target="_blank">National Bullying Prevention Month</a>, and groups across the United States will be talking about why it’s so important to think about what it takes to be a good friend and think about other people’s feelings. Wubbzy , Walden, Widget and Daizy are taking a stand to end bullying everywhere.  Always remember that friends are Wubbtastic!</p>
<p><a href="/iwubbzy/wubbzy_bullyingpreventionmonth/wubbzy-redbluegroup/" rel="attachment wp-att-1564"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564" title="wubbzy-RedBlueGroup" src="/iwubbzy/media/2012/10/wubbzy-RedBlueGroup.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="769" /></a></p>
<p>Be more than a bystander, it’s time to STOP all types of bullying. The <a title="The Big Help" href="https://www.nick.com/thebighelp/anti-bullying/" target="_blank">end of bullying begins with you</a> and how you treat others.  Speak up when you see bullying and tell an adult, take some time to help friends who may need you to listen, love people for who they are, and always tell mommy, daddy or an adult how you feel. Adults can help you prevent bullying behavior in schools and your community and can even respond quickly to stop cyber bullying, helping to keep kids, just like you, safe and sound.</p>
<p>Know that you are <a title="You Are Unique" href="https://youtu.be/LwwuX4kd_5Q" target="_blank">perfect just the way you are</a> and that kids can help kids. You can reach out and be a helpful friend to someone who is being hurt. Unite against bullying. Be a hero. Know that you CAN always make a difference.  There is a wealth of resources available to empower, educate and support those who want to end bullying.</p>
<p>Here is information for <a title="Anti-Bullying Tips for Grown-Ups" href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/on-the-spot/index.html" target="_blank">grown-ups who encounter bullying</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intervene immediately. It is ok for an adult to help.</li>
<li>Separate the kids involved.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone is safe.</li>
<li>Meet any immediate medical or mental health needs.</li>
<li>Stay calm. Reassure the kids involved, including bystanders.</li>
<li>Model respectful behavior when you intervene.</li>
</ul>
